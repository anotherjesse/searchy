Searchy
=======
A quicksilver-like interface to search within your browser

USAGE
=====
Hitting Ctrl-Shift-K (or apple-shift-k if on OSX) brings up
a window that does search as you type.

Use the up/down arrows to select your result and hit return
to go to that page (hitting ctrl/accel return will take you
to that result in a new tab).

The next time bring up the search panel it will have your
last search, results, and location so you can continue your
search from there.

Cool feature:
If you want to restrict it to the current domain start your
query with @
